<h1>Endless Conflict (EC)</h1>

Welcome in repository of turn based multi-player browser game. Game is currently in development process and we are working
on final specification and implementation of first playable version 1.0.

<h2>Game concept</h2>
Game itself is divided into separate Ages. Age is one game in EC, which has set up start date, condition of win and has specific configuration.

<h2>Players</h2>
Every user can register one account in EC. With this account he can join every Age, which is not finished.
Joining age means, that user will create land with which he will be able to play against other players, which has land in same age.

<h2>Land</h2>
Lands are main aspects of game. Every player can create one land in every age.
Every land has several attributes like
<ul>
    <li><strong>Size</strong> of land in square kilometers.</li>
    <li><Strong>Amount of people</strong> living in the land.
    <li><strong>Happiness</strong> of people is percentage information based on many factors.
    <li><strong>Military preparedness</strong> is another important percentage information, which affect fighting ability of land.
    
</ul>
